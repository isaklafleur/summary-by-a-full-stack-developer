# JavaScript Testing \(Unit Testing & TDD\)

## Unit Testing

A unit test runs some code over a segment of your program checking the input and output. These tests allow developers to check individual areas of a program to see where\(and why\) errors occur.

This comes with an inherent understanding of what you’re trying to test for and how the code should function. Checking for bugs and errors can only be useful when you know exactly what you’re looking for.

## Why Unit Testing?

Developers should love the security of unit tests. Nobody loves writing unit tests, but the peace of mind they bring can easily be worth the extra work.

**Unit tests check blocks of code **to ensure that they all run as expected. This is very common for traditional software development and now very common in web development too.

**It exist many different Unit Testing Frameworks. The most popular are **[**Jasmine**](https://jasmine.github.io)**, **[**Mocha**](https://mochajs.org/)**, **[**Tape**](https://github.com/substack/tape)**, **[**Jest**](https://facebook.github.io/jest/)**.**

## Mocha

Install with [npm](https://npmjs.org/) globally:

```bash
$ npm install --global mocha
