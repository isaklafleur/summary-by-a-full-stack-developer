# JavaScript Scope \(Local & Global\)

---

**Scope determines the accessibility \(visibility\) of variables.**

In JavaScript there are two types of scope:

* Local scope
* Global scope

JavaScript has function scope: Each function creates a new scope. Scope determines the accessibility \(visibility\) of these variables. Variables defined inside a function are not accessible \(visible\) from outside the function.
